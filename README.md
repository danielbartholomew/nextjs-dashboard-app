## Next.js App Router Course - Demo

This is the [introductory course](https://nextjs.org/learn) from the Next.js website.

I have extended the course to add two new pages that mock a reactive sidebar using components from [shacdn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components). The new pages are fairly static and don't have a backend.   

Both implementations use a sidebar to render some components within it.
The first implementation uses an accordion control to render a few simple components within it. This uses a single route to manage the entire sidebar. 
The second implementation uses different routes to display content within the sidebar, and has some navigation within the sidebar.
